# How to upgrade to Windows 10

## Why?

Some people spread hate about [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10) for various reasons, one of them being [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection) ; but if you were really concerned about your privacy, you would have installed [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian) instead of [Windows 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7), and have an [iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) instead of an [Android](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)>) phone, [but that's none of my business](http://i.memeful.com/memes/R543qxM/Kermit-The-Frog.jpg).

The fear of change is what most people experience when they think about Windows 10 and is the main reason why they won't upgrade. However, there are several good reasons to upgrade.
